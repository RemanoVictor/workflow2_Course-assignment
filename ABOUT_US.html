    <h1> <u>A look back...</u> </h1>
        
    <p> Re-Cycle city tours was started in 2015 by a group of friends who sought to showcase the beauty in and around the city in a completely different way. The group of friends started with 3 bicycles and learned all they needed to about the landmarks of the city while mapping the best routes to take on bike.</p>
    
    <p> After just a year, the idea of 3 friends has sparked a shift in how people get around their city and has brought a new sense of appreciation of their surroundings. </p>
